## Project Assignment A

Step 1: Generate the NFTs

    1.1 I cloned an open source code on GitHub from https://github.com/HashLips.
    1.2 I created layers of PNG images using Photoshop.
    1.3 I edited the code and files, while adding my layers, to generate my own NFTs.
    1.4 I configured the code so that it generated 35 different combinations of layers where each one generated a unique NFT.
    1.5 After all the updates, I committed the changed code and files to Git.
  
Step 2: Host the metadata on IPFS

    2.1 I used Pinata to host the metadata.
    2.2 To host the metadata I needed to upload the image file in Pinata.
    2.3 After Uploading the file, Pinata generates a token, which I insert in the metadata Json code.
    2.4 After that, my metadata was hosted in IPFS.
    2.5 The metadata and the images can be accessed in the IPFS through the following links - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc5gRshgUsD2uUGFhckLCpG5N1nvWMb6vHzFqNzCg7Nre/ - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcDLsf6cMF8YX1FHN2wNHThXw2Kr4djrAgbkQ3XCrycBd/1.json
  
  Step 3: List the collection in OpenSea
  
    3.1 I created a collection in OpenSea
    3.2 I posted the NFTs in the collection 
    3.3 The NFTs can be accessed through the following link: https://opensea.io/collection/great-animals-in-great-places
    
  Step 4: Smart Contracts
  
    4.1 At first, I tried to make the smart contracts using Remix, however it is paid and I could not buy cryptocurrencies to pay the Gas Fee
    4.2 In any event, I created my digital wallet for MetaMask
  
  Step 5: OpenSea Contract
  
    5.1 By accessing the NFT listed in OpenSea and clicking in "Details" we can access the contract.
    5.2 When accessing, we get the toke - 0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963
    5.3 We can Check the contract in polygonscan, just access - https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963
    
  Conclusion:
    
     I created a collection of NFTs using open source, just making the changes I wanted, to create my own self-authored collection,hosted the metadata on IPFS and listed my collection on OpenSea. It was a very exciting and challenging job to do, I had no experience in the process of creating an NFT and I could notice that it is a more complex and secure job than I believed it would be.
